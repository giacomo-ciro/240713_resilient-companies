# Resilient Companies
This repo hosts a streamlit webapp for the Resilient Companies project.  
We collected a wide range of data about indian companies with more than 10M revenues from 2017 to 2023 and analyzed as follows:  
1) We computed key financial metrics, such as Revenue Growth and Operating Margin;  
2) We identified the so-called **break-aways** companies as those companies whose RG and OM were consinstenly above industry average;  
3) We classified companies into:  
  - **Resilient**, those with above-average performance both _before_ and _after_ year 2020;
  - **New-breakaways**, those with above-average performance only _after_ year 2020;
  - **Non-resilient**, those with above-average performance only _before_ year 2020.
